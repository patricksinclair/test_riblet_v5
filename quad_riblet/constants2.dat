//double p_0 = 1.;    //pressure at LHS
//double p_1 = 0;     //pressure at RHS

double u_max = 0.5;  //x_velocity at the top of the inlet linear gradient

//double L = 0.6485;	//length of system.  This depends on riblet setup so be careful. Also look at scaling.
double h = 0.5e-3;		  //height of system.  Again, be aware of scaling factor in blockMeshDict.

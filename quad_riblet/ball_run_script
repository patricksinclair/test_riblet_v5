#This is a script to reset the openfoam case and run it again.
#This one has been modified for use on the ball cluster.  Due to the differing openfoam versions, we don't remove alpha.water, and we use more processors
#First delete everything
foamListTimes -rm
rm -r processor*
cp 0/alpha.water.orig 0/alpha.water
#rm 0/alpha.water

#now set everything up
blockMesh
setFields
decomposePar

#now run the case in parallel

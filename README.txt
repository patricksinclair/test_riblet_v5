This is based on the gradient slippy riblet case.  We'll change it by changing the geometry to 4 riblets, all on the micron scale

This is the scaled down version based on the AkzoNobel riblet paper dimensions.

Boundary conditions changed to the ones from the pipe pdf, the ones used in the slippy riblet one.

Uniform U at the LHS, then hopefully poiseuille flow develops before it reaches the riblets.
